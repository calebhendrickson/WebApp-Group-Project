# Creating Branches
**NEVER** branch from `master`. Instead, branch from `develop` or your own branch.

## Features
Name the branch `feature/name-of-feature`.

## Bugs
Name the branch `bugfix/name-of-bug`.

# Merging
If merging to a branch that isn't yours, submit a merge request. 
If it's urgent, message the current project manager on 
GroupMe with a few "!"s. Otherwise, exclude the exclamation marks.

**Important:** make merge requests to `develop` or whatever the parent branch is. 

**DO NOT TOUCH MASTER:** Always always always defer to the project manager for changes
to `master`. The only changes to `maste`r should be merge requests from `develop`.
