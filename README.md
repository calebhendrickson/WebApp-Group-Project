# go-getter-social

> A Vue.js social media event app developed for SE 329 at Iowa State University.


## Goal
> The goal is for this app to function as an event focused social media site with
user authentication and posting.

## Big Idea
> The posts will allow users to create "events" that will be in the near future (i.e. tonight).

> The users friends will be able to RSVP for an event up to a given cap, at which point
the event will be removed from the friends' feeds.

## Build Setup

# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
